Introduction
=================

Q-RAS Plugin is a preprocessing for geometry preparation in HEC-RAS.

The steps to using Q-RAS Plugin are fairly simple:

#. Load in QGIS a Digital Elevation Model in grid format in a projected crs
#. Digitize a stream network vector line from **upstream do downstream**
#. Digitize a Cross sections vector line from **downstream do upstream** from **left overbank to righ toverbank**
#. Designate where to store your new geometry file
#. press OK
#. Open HEC-RAS and enjoy

Limititation of current version
=================

This version of Plugin Q-RAS is an experimental version. It's need more tests anb presents some limitation:
- only one river can be processed
- only one reach can be processed
- the plugin does not repoject your data so user have to use a consistent crs
- the plugin is not able (for now) to integrate in geometry any structure, bridge, banks, obstructions
